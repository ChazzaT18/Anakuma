              Welcome to Anakuma, where Asian fusion cuisine meets heartfelt
              hospitality in the heart of Brighton's vibrant Preston Street.
              Founded by us, brothers Ali and Mo Razavi, Anakuma is our tribute
              to our late mother, Lindsay, whose love for cooking and family
              inspires every dish we serve. Our journey began with our beloved
              first restaurant, Halisco, just a stone's throw away. Buoyed by
              the success of Halisco and driven by our passion for the rich food
              culture of Brighton, we envisioned Anakuma as a place where we
              could offer something new and exciting: high-quality
              Asian-inspired cuisine in a warm, inviting setting.

              At Anakuma, we take pride in our carefully curated menu that
              celebrates the flavors of Asia with a twist. From our flavorful
              small plates to our signature bao buns and inventive cocktails,
              each dish is crafted to be shared and enjoyed among friends and
              family. Step inside and you'll find a space that blends rustic
              charm with modern comfortâ€”high ceilings, ambient lighting, and
              cozy seating create the perfect backdrop for any occasion, whether
              it's a casual evening out or a special celebration.
